/**
 * 356. Line Reflection
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/line-reflection/
 *
 * Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to the y-axis
 * that reflects the given points symmetrically.
 *
 * In other words, answer whether or not if there exists a line that after reflecting all
 * points over the given line, the original points' set is the same as the reflected ones.
 *
 * Note that there can be repeated points.

// Example test cases
const example1 = [

    [-1, 1],
]

// Explanation: We can choose the line x = 0

const example2 = [
    [1, 1],
    [-1, -1],

console.log(isReflected(example2)) // Expected: false
// Explanation: We can't choose a line
